GCalCron2
=========

The goal of GCalCron is to use Google Calendar as a GUI to your crontab. It enable you to have at the same time:
 - clean and reliable scheduling thanks to the use of Unix native tools
 - a great user interface for quick and easy scheduling and re-scheduling using Google Calendar, available on all platforms, web and mobile.

A common use of this tool is to administer a home automation server. Using GCalCron2, changing your wake-up time before going to bed is as easy as changing the time of the associated Google Calendar event
